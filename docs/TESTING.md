# Image-Resizer Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the image-resizer application, with a focus on ensuring the reliability of the R2 integration with Cloudflare Image Resizing. Current test coverage includes 284 tests across 26 test files, providing comprehensive testing of the ServiceRegistry, CDN-CGI pattern, direct R2 access, multi-layered fallback approach, deployment modes, and R2 binding configurations.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Testing individual functions and components in isolation
- Mocking external dependencies
- Focus on specific behavior rather than integration

### 2. Integration Tests
- Testing interactions between components
- Testing service integrations
- Focus on interface compliance and communication

### 3. Functional Tests
- Testing complete features and user scenarios
- Minimal mocking, using real service implementations where possible
- Focus on end-to-end functionality

### 4. Environmental Tests
- Testing with different environment configurations
- Testing in specific deployment modes (direct, remote, hybrid)
- Testing with different Cloudflare Worker configurations

## Lessons Learned from Testing Implementation

1. **Mock Flexibility**: Keep assertions flexible enough to handle implementation changes. Testing for exact header values like `x-source: 'r2-cf-proxy-transform'` is fragile because the implementation may change. Better to test for presence of headers or general behavior.

2. **Request Chain Mocking**: The Cloudflare Image Resizing workflow requires careful mocking of each step in the transformation chain, particularly:
   - R2 object retrieval
   - Fetch operations with CDN-CGI patterns
   - Response header propagation

3. **Implementation Independence**: The fallback mechanisms may change over time as Cloudflare improves their platform. Tests should focus on the outcome (successfully transformed images) rather than the specific mechanism used.

4. **Multiple Mock Strategies**: We needed to use different mocking approaches:
   - Complete fetch mock reset for specific test cases
   - Mock implementations that vary response based on URL patterns
   - Response headers that simulate CloudFlare Image Resizing
   
5. **Service Lifecycle Management**: When testing dependency injection and service registry:
   - Create clean registry instance for each test to avoid cross-test interference
   - Test all lifecycle patterns (singleton, scoped, transient) separately
   - Verify proper hierarchy resolution in multi-service dependency chains
   - Create realistic R2-compatible mock objects that implement the minimum necessary interface

## Mocking Strategy for R2

Our successful approach to R2 mocking includes:

```typescript
// Mock R2 object class
class MockR2Object {
  body: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
  httpMetadata: { contentType: string };
  size: number;

  constructor(contentType: string, size: number) {
    // Create a simple stream with some bytes for testing
    this.body = new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        const bytes = new Uint8Array(10);
        controller.enqueue(bytes);
        controller.close();
      }
    });
    this.httpMetadata = { contentType };
    this.size = size;
  }
}

// Mock R2 bucket with get method
const mockR2Bucket = {
  get: vi.fn(async (key: string) => {
    if (key === 'image.jpg') {
      return new MockR2Object('image/jpeg', 1000000); // 1MB original size
    }
    if (key === 'not-an-image.txt') {
      return new MockR2Object('text/plain', 1000);
    }
    return null; // Not found for other keys
  }),
};

// Mock environment with R2 bucket
const mockEnv = {
  IMAGES_BUCKET: mockR2Bucket,
  ORIGIN_CONFIG: JSON.stringify({
    default_priority: ['r2', 'remote', 'fallback'],
    r2: {
      enabled: true,
      binding_name: 'IMAGES_BUCKET'
    }
  }),
  // Other environment variables
};

// Mock fetch responses for CDN-CGI patterns
vi.mocked(fetch).mockImplementation((input) => {
  const url = typeof input === 'string' ? input : input.url;
  
  // CDN-CGI pattern detection for successful transformation
  if (url.includes('/cdn-cgi/image/')) {
    return Promise.resolve(new Response('Transformed Image Data', {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'image/webp',
        'cf-resized': 'internal=ok/- q=80 n=800+600 c=300+200',
        'content-length': '50000', // Smaller than original
        'x-source': 'r2-cf-proxy-transform',
      }
    }));
  }
  
  // Default response
  return Promise.resolve(new Response('Image data', { status: 200 }));
});
```

## Testing Guidelines Updates

Based on our experience implementing the R2 tests, we've learned:

1. **Avoid Brittle Tests**: Don't test for exact implementation details (like specific `x-source` header values) that might change. Instead, test for behavior (successful transformation) using stable indicators like content-length reduction or the presence of `cf-resized` headers.

2. **Reset Mocks Deliberately**: Use `vi.mocked(fetch).mockReset()` to ensure each test has a clean fetch implementation, as the mocks are shared between tests.

3. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be completely self-contained with its own mock setup to prevent unexpected interactions.

4. **Test Actual Behavior**: Focus on the outcomes that matter to users (images get resized) rather than internal implementation details.

5. **Expect Fallbacks**: Design tests that acknowledge the multi-layered fallback approach rather than assuming a single path.

6. **Mock Complex Objects**: When mocking complex objects like R2 buckets or R2 objects, create helper classes that implement the minimum necessary interfaces rather than trying to mock every method and property.

7. **Override Return Values For Specific Tests**: For tests with specific requirements, use `mockReturnValueOnce()` or `mockImplementationOnce()` to change behavior for just one test call.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing tests according to the updated priority list:
   - ✅ ~~ServiceRegistry Tests (test/core/serviceRegistry.test.ts)~~ - COMPLETED with 12 test cases
   - End-to-end Worker Tests with R2 (test/index.test.ts) - NEXT PRIORITY
   - Multi-layered Fallback Tests (test/integration/fallbackApproach.test.ts)
   - Deployment Modes Tests (test/environment/deploymentModes.test.ts)

2. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline for automatic verification:
   - Add GitHub Actions for running tests on PRs
   - Configure test coverage reports

3. Consider adding performance tests for R2 integration:
   - Measure response time differences between R2 and remote modes
   - Test caching performance with R2 objects

4. Expand test coverage metrics:
   - Generate reports for untested code paths
   - Focus on increasing coverage for critical R2 integration code
