# Consolidated Implementation Approach

## Overview

Based on our investigation, we should implement a simplified strategy approach that routes requests through the most appropriate transformation path based on the domain and environment.

## Recommended Strategy Configuration

### 1. Production - Custom Domains (images.erfi.dev)

Use the Interceptor strategy for custom domains in production, as it provides the best performance:

```json
"priorityOrder": [
  "interceptor", 
  "cdn-cgi", 
  "direct-url", 
  "remote-fallback", 
  "direct-serving"
]
```

### 2. Development - Workers.dev Domains

For workers.dev domains, completely disable the Interceptor strategy and use CDN-CGI as the primary approach:

```json
"priorityOrder": [
  "cdn-cgi", 
  "direct-url", 
  "remote-fallback", 
  "direct-serving"
]
```

## Implementation Rationale

1. **The Interceptor Strategy**:
   - Works best on custom domains (images.erfi.dev)
   - Has issues with workers.dev domains
   - Provides highest performance when it works
   - Should be disabled entirely on workers.dev

2. **The CDN-CGI Strategy**:
   - Works reliably on all domains
   - Slightly lower performance than interceptor
   - Good fallback option
   - Should be primary strategy on workers.dev

3. **Other Strategies**:
   - Provide fallbacks for error cases
   - Should be included in all environments

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Clear path for each environment
2. **Reliability**: Avoids known issues with interceptor on workers.dev
3. **Performance**: Uses most efficient strategy when possible
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration without code changes

## Implementation Steps

1. Add the `STRATEGIES_CONFIG` to wrangler.jsonc:
   - Development: Disable interceptor, use cdn-cgi
   - Production: Use interceptor as primary

2. Update the environment detection in `environmentService.ts`:
   - Ensure it correctly identifies workers.dev domains
   - Apply domain-specific strategy configurations

3. Test each environment separately:
   - Verify workers.dev correctly uses cdn-cgi
   - Verify custom domains use interceptor
   - Check fallback mechanisms work

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Workers.dev Domains**:
   - Uses CDN-CGI approach
   - No interceptor-related errors
   - Consistent behavior

2. **Custom Domains**:
   - Uses high-performance Interceptor approach
   - Falls back to CDN-CGI if needed
   - Better overall performance

3. **All Environments**:
   - Consistent logging
   - Accurate debug headers
   - Reliable operation

By following this approach, we can simplify the implementation while ensuring that each environment uses the most appropriate strategy for its specific circumstances.
