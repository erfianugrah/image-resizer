# Configuration Issue and Solution

## Problem Identified

You were experiencing issues with configuration settings not being respected, specifically:
1. Strategy priorities not being correctly applied (R2 still being evaluated despite removal from priority list)
2. Inconsistencies between headers and logs
3. Environment-specific settings not being applied

## Root Cause

1. **Missing Configuration Schema**: The application had no centralized way to define and load strategy configuration
2. **Hard-Coded Defaults**: Strategy priorities were hard-coded in multiple places
3. **No Domain-Specific Configuration**: The system couldn't handle different settings for workers.dev vs. custom domains
4. **Configuration Loading Issues**: JSON parsing from environment variables was inconsistent

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive solution:

1. **Centralized Configuration Schema**:
   - Added schema definition in `configSchema.ts`
   - Implemented validation to ensure configuration correctness

2. **Configuration Service Enhancement**:
   - Added support for `STRATEGIES_CONFIG` environment variable
   - Improved parsing with type checking and defaults
   - Added domain-specific configuration support

3. **Environment-Aware Strategy Selection**:
   - Implemented the EnvironmentService to detect domain type
   - Created domain-specific strategy prioritization

4. **Documentation and Debugging Tools**:
   - Created comprehensive configuration documentation
   - Added debugging tools for configuration issues

## Implementation Files

1. **Updated Files**:
   - `src/services/configurationService.ts` - Enhanced to load strategy configuration
   - `src/services/environmentService.ts` - Improved domain-specific behavior
   - `src/services/strategyRegistry.ts` - Added proper prioritization based on config

2. **New Files**:
   - `docs/architecture/CONFIGURATION.md` - Documentation on configuration system
   - `updates/updated_wrangler_with_strategies.md` - Configuration examples for wrangler.jsonc
   - `updates/add_debug_output.ts` - Debugging script for configuration issues

## How to Use the Solution

1. **Add Strategy Configuration to wrangler.jsonc**:
   - Add `STRATEGIES_CONFIG` variable in each environment's `vars` section
   - Configure domain-specific behavior in `domainConfig`
   - Set appropriate strategy priorities

2. **Verify Configuration Loading**:
   - Use the debug script to view loaded configuration
   - Check browser console for environment variables
   - Verify the service is using expected priorities

3. **Adjust Domain-Specific Settings**:
   - For workers.dev domains, prioritize CDN-CGI strategy
   - For custom domains, prioritize interceptor strategy

## Expected Results

After implementing these changes:

1. **Consolidated Strategy Approach**:
   - workers.dev domains: Use only CDN-CGI (disable interceptor entirely)
   - Custom domains: Use interceptor as primary, CDN-CGI as fallback
   - Consistent handling for each domain type

2. **Configuration Control**:
   - Environment-specific strategy enablement via config
   - Domain-specific strategy priorities
   - No code changes needed to adjust behavior

3. **Better Diagnostics**:
   - Enhanced debug headers with current strategy information
   - Detailed logging of strategy attempts
   - Clear configuration validation errors

4. **Implementation Simplicity**:
   - Clear separation between domain types
   - Predictable behavior in each environment 
   - Reliable fallback mechanisms
